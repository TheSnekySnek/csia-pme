# Description
This is a sample service, to get it running, watch for the TODOs and replace "SAMPLE_SERVICE" and "SAMPLE-SERVICE" in the files with the name of the service

TODO: DESCRIBE SERVICE HERE...

TODO: Add your service to [GitHub Actions](../.github) and once the service is published, change the visibility of the package ([_Configuring visibility of container images for an organization_ - docs.github.com](https://docs.github.com/en/packages/learn-github-packages/configuring-a-packages-access-control-and-visibility#configuring-visibility-of-container-images-for-an-organization)).

# How to run
## Environment variables
Using both docker or your local python3, the engine will use the following environment variables if defined.

*General variables*

- APP_HOST: address on which the API will listen, default is 127.0.0.1
- APP_PORT: port the API will listen on, default is 8080
- APP_LOG: log level, default is info
- APP_ENGINE: the url to the engine, if provided, the service will announce itself to the engine periodically
- APP_SERVICE: the url of the service itself, needed to announce correct routes to the engine
- APP_NOTIFY_CRON: the frequency in second of the heartbeat announce to the engine, default is 30

## Run natively
### Install dependencies
Install the requirements using `pip3`

```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

* In order to work, some packages may need a few additional libs that you can install with your distribution package manager, check console at run time.
### Run the tests
To run the tests, the following additional packages must be installed:

```bash
pip3 install pytest pytest-asyncio aiofile
```

Then, the tests can be run with:
```bash
python3 -m pytest --asyncio-mode=auto
```

### Run
Then, you can run the following command to run it in dev:

```bash
python3 main.py
```

or with custom environment variables:

```bash
APP_HOST=0.0.0.0 APP_PORT=4040 APP_LOG=info APP_... python3 main.py
```

## Run locally using Kubernetes

TODO: Update the [Get started](../docs/get-started.md) and [Services](../docs/services.md) documentation pages to include the new service

Refer to the [Get started](../docs/get-started.md) documentation in order to run this service locally.

## Use
The API documentation is automatically generated by FastAPI using the OpenAPI standard. A user friendly interface provided by Swagger is available under the `/docs` route, where the endpoints of teh service are described.

This simple service only has one route `/compute` that takes an image as input, which will be used to guess the number.
