# Documentation

Welcome to the documentation for this project! You should find everything you need here. Hope it helps!

## Terminology of this documentation

The terminology of this documentation is as follow:

_We use a set of [**tools**](./tools/index.md) to develop and promote a machine learning platform. This platform is composed of machine learning [**services**](./services/index.md) that can be chained together to solve a problem. The chaining can be visualized through a [**webapp**](./webapp/index.md). All the machine learning services are orchestrated by an [**engine**](./engine/index.md). The platform is deployed on an [**infrastructure**](./infrastructure/index.md) managed by [**providers**](./providers/index.md)._

_The whole project is managed by a [**team**](./team/index.md) where all human and technical processes are described in [**guides**](./guides/index.md)._

_New people can use [**templates**](./templates/index.md) to bootstrap their machine learning services. Some services use custom [**Docker images**](./docker-images/index.md)._
