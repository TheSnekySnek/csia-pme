# Documentation

Welcome to the documentation for this project! You should find everything you need here. Hope it helps!

## Terminology of this documentation

The terminology of this documentation is as follow:

_We use a set of [**tools**](./tools/readme.md) to develop and promote a machine learning platform. This platform is composed of machine learning [**services**](./services/readme.md) that can be chained together to solve a problem. The chaining can be visualized through a [**webapp**](./webapp/readme.md). All the machine learning services are orchestrated by an [**engine**](./engine/readme.md). The platform is deployed on an [**infrastructure**](./infrastructure/readme.md) managed by [**providers**](./providers/readme.md)._

_The whole project is managed by a [**team**](./team/readme.md) where all human and technical processes are described in [**guides**](./guides/readme.md)._

_New people can use [**templates**](./templates/readme.md) to bootstrap their machine learning services. Some services use custom [**Docker images**](./docker-images/readme.md)._
